### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m focused on getting companies to go paperless and embrace digital tools. See more about his [here](https://asw.ro/) - my very own "Dexter's laboratory" in the last years
- 💬 Ask me about my views on family life, coffee or my "do more" philosophy and we might end up much further than planned 😀
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ❤️ writing utencils and it seems like the japanese have mastered the trade of high quality and precision in this field (see [Uni -Mitsubishi pencils](https://www.uniball.com/home/index.html) or [Pentel](http://www.pentelworld.com/) products to find out for yourself)
